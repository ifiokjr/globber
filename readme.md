## Contributing

To contribute first update your cache with

```bash
deno task lock
```

This both generates the lockfile and makes sure the same cache is used for all contributors.

To check that all you code is working as expected, run:

```bash
deno task check
```

This will test, lint and check that formatting is correct.
